### Dockstore 2.0
#### Enhancing a community platform for sharing cloud-agnostic research tools
<small>

##### https://dockstore.org/

[Dockstore](https://dockstore.org/) is a
repository of scientific workflows described using
popular workflow languages with their dependencies
distributed in Docker images. This powerful combination
of technologies allows for improved sharing and
portability of scientific workflows

### Forome Association

<small>

#### https://forome.org/ 
##### Github: https://github.com/ForomePlatform

Founded by BGM as part of the interdisciplinary crowdsourcing strategy, 
the association facilitates an open collaboration for the undiagnosed rare diseases research 
and patient cases faster resolution 
by discovering novel genes via crowdsourcing and bioinformatics tools development.

### RAWG
#### RNA-Seq analysis workflow generator
<small>

##### GitHub: https://github.com/rawgene 
##### Demo Website: http://rawg.tony.tc

RAWG is designed for the facilitated generation, execution and
comparison of multi-pipeline RNA-Seq workflows. RAWG consists of
a webportal, a set of CWL tool wrappers and a CWL workflow
generation engine (Flowgen)

### SAPPORO
#### workflow management system that supports continuous testing of workflows
<small>

##### https://github.com/suecharo/SAPPORO

[Sapporo](http://app.core-apps.com/ismb-eccb19/event/9f6b4cf921b32af6327cdbd218bfae69) is a workflow and individual task execution system.
 It is also useful for continuous testing of workflows.
 SAPPORO is an implementation of GA4GH Workflow
Execution Service (WES). It is designed to separate
compute and storage, which enables easy
deployment. The system also provides GUI to
manage workflow runs.

### NGLess
#### a domain-specific language for NGS analysis 
<small>

##### Github: https://github.com/PMCC-BioinformaticsCore/janis
##### Docs: https://janis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Linking different tools is an integral part of bioinformatics and software
building tools (such as GNU Make) or workflow engines have both been employed
to tackle this problem, but are not specific to bioinformatics. We present an
alternative approach, namely a domain-specific language (named NGLess) for
defining next-generation sequencing (NGS) processing pipelines and show its
advantages over the use of generic tools.

### Janis
#### An open source tool to machine generate type-safe CWL and WDL workflows

<small>

##### Github: https://github.com/PMCC-BioinformaticsCore/janis
##### Docs: https://janis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Janis is a framework creating specialised,
simple workflow definitions that are then transpiled to
Common Workflow Language or Workflow Definition Language.

Janis gives you an API to build computational workflows 
and will generate a workflow description in CWL and WDL.
By using Janis, you get type-safety, 
portability and reproducibility across all of your execution environments.

### Benten
#### An experimental language server for the Common Workflow Language

<small>

##### Github: https://github.com/rabix/benten

Benten is a language server for Common Workflow Language documents.
Many advanced CWL users are comfortable creating tools and workflows "by hand" using a plain text editor. 
When creating complex enough workflows navigating and editing the resultant document and sub-documents can get tedious. 
Keeping track of the bigger picture (what components have been added, what connections have been set) can also get hard.

Benten is a language server that offers help with code snippets, navigation and syntax checking of CWL documents.
