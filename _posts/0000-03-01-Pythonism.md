The Biopython Project is an open-source collection of non-commercial Python tools 
for computational biology and bioinformatics, 
created by an international association of developers.

It is a distributed collaborative effort to develop Python libraries and applications 
which address the needs of current and future work in bioinformatics.

### Biotite
#### A comprehensive and efficient computational molecular biology library in Python

<small>

###### https://www.biotite-python.org/

The Biotite package bundles popular tasks in computational molecular biology into a unifying Python framework. 
It can handle a major part of the molecular biology workflow for sequence and biomolecular structure data:

* Fetching data from biological databases
* Loading data from structure/sequence files
* Analyzing and editing the data
* Saving the data back to file
* Interfacing external applications

The internal structure and sequence representations are based on NumPy ndarray objects.

### pysradb
#### A Python package to query next-generation sequencing metadata and data from NCBI Sequence Read Archive

<small>

##### Github: https://github.com/saketkc/pysradb

pysradb is a python package that provides a collection of command line methods to query and download metadata and data 
from NCBIâ€™s Sequence Read Archive (SRA) utilizing the curated metadata database available through the SRAdb project.

It provides utility functions that will further help a user perform more granular queries, that are
often required when dealing with multiple datasets at large scale. By enabling both metadata search and download 
operations at the command-line, pysradb aims to bridge the gap in seamlessly retrieving public sequencing datasets 
and the associated metadata.
