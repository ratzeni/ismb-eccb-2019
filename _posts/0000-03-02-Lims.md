MISO is a laboratory information management system designed for eukaryotic sequencing
operations. It supports genomic, exomic, transcriptomic, methyl-omic, and CHiP-seq protocols;
long reads and short reads; and microarrays. MISO incorporates a wide feature set useful for
both large and small facilities to track their lab workflows in great detail. 
MISO has two primary goals: 

1. to allow laboratory technicians to record their work accurately, without having to adapt
their protocols to match the systemâ€™s model, with a minimum of data entry overhead 
2. to keep the associated metadata valid and structured enough to use for automation and other
downstream applications.

##### Demo: http://parkour-demo.ie-freiburg.mpg.de

Parkour, a software package for sample processing and quality management 
of next generation sequencing data and samples. 
Starting with user requests, Parkour allows tracking and assessing samples based 
on predefined quality criteria through different stages of the sample preparation workflow. 
Ideally suited for academic core laboratories, the software aims to maximize efficiency and 
reduce turnaround time by intelligent sample grouping and a clear assignment of staff to work units. 
Tools for automated invoicing, interactive statistics on facility usage and simple report generation 
minimize administrative tasks. 
Provided as a web application, Parkour is a convenient tool for both deep sequencing service users 
and laboratory personal. 
A set of web APIs allow coordinated information sharing with local and remote bioinformaticians. 
The flexible structure allows workflow customization and simple addition 
of new features as well as the expansion to other domains.
