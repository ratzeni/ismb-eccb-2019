| Findable | Accessible | Interoperable | Reusable
|---|---|---|---
| F1. (meta)data are assigned a globally unique and eternally persistent identifier. | A1  (meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol. | I1. (meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation. | R1. meta(data) have a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes.
| F2. data are described with rich metadata. | A1.1 the protocol is open, free, and universally implementable. | I2. (meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles. | R1.1. (meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license.
| F3. (meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource. | A1.2 the protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary. | I3. (meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data. | R1.2. (meta)data are associated with their provenance.
| F4. metadata specify the data identifier. | A2 metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available. |  |

### FAIR in InterMine

<small>

##### http://intermine.org/

InterMine is an open source data warehouse system, used to create databases of biological data 
accessed by sophisticated web query tools.
InterMine can be used to create databases from a single data set or can integrate multiple sources of data. 

Support is provided for several common biological formats and there is a framework for adding other data. 

InterMine includes a user-friendly web interface that works 'out of the box' and can be easily customised.

### (Re)Usable Data Project

<small>

#### http://reusabledata.org/

The goal of the (Re)usable Data Project (RDP)
is to draw attention to the licensing issues that make the reuse of
valuable biomedical data challenging and complicated. The RDP is meant
to provide an explorable resource that looks at some of the issues
around the reuse of scientific data and open a conversation about how
to deal with them. The RDP exists as an element in the environment of
the FAIR Data Principles and the FAIR-TLC evaluation framework; it is
focused on licensing issues and seeks to draw attention to the
pervasiveness of current practice failures and their effects.

As the current project centerpiece, the RDP has put together a rubric
that attempts to objectively evaluate resource licensing and basic
data accessibility from the perspective of reuse on a linear
scale.

### GA4GH
#### Developing Open Standards for Responsible Data Sharing

<small>

###### https://www.ga4gh.org/

The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) is creating frameworks and standards to enable the responsible, 
voluntary, and secure sharing of genomic and health-related data. 

GA4GH Specifications include file formats such as CRAM and BCF, 
Cloud compute enabling standards such as Workflow Execution Service (WES), 
and a path to match patients consent for data use with researchers areas of interest.
